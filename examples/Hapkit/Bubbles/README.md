# Bubbles
Upload the Bubbles_arduino to the Hapkit then run the processing sketch. Bubbles will float to the surface of the bottle and you can try plugging up the bottle and feeling the bubble objects interact with the device. 

*Note* There have been some known issues running at too high a baud rate on some devices. If you notice many errors being thrown try turning down the baud rate to 57600 bps and then set the frame rate in the setup to 40 Hz.
