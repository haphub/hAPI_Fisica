# hAPI Fisica
The hAPI Fisica library is a wrapper to enable haptic functionality in Richard Marxer's fisica library for Processing. The Fisica library wraps the JBox2D physics engine so that it can be easily used within the Processing environment. hAPI Fisica enables this library to be used with the Haply Development kit and Hapkit. 

The detailed documentation can be found at: https://haphub.github.io/hAPI_Fisica/

see also: https://haphub.github.io/hAPI/ for information on how the hAPI interfaces between Processing and the Haply and Hapkit open-sourced haptic devices
